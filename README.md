Hello!

This is a simple timer in HTML/CSS/JS implementation. 
This is just a beginner project so IDK what the hell do I put here.

Wanted to add music onload and alarm sounds pero deadlinerz mn and busy w/ other matters so haha.

Anyways, will probably try to improve this page as I learn more.

That's it, bye!
